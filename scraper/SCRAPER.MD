# SCRAPERS SCANALYZE

A 'scraper' (or a 'web scraping tool') is a computer program designed to automatically extract data from a website. The usefulness of a scraper for retrieving products and their prices from a store's website can be explained in several ways.

## Use
Please check in the document [README.MD](./README.md).

## What data is scraped ?
It depends on the store. For each store, a list of items to be scanned is defined, based on the website content. For example, Migros indicates the quantity in a specific field, making it easy to scrape this information.

In addition, we add the product category, which has been defined in advance according to the location on the website.

You can find the list of the categories [here](../docs/categorization/categorization.md)
